seamless

seamless is a terrain engine for osgEarth. It takes over rendering of
the map from internal map engine of osgEarth. It uses the LOD
algorithm described in "Seamless Patches for GPU-Based Terrain
Rendering" by Livny, Kogan and El-Sana. A copy of the paper can be
downloaded from http://wscg.zcu.cz/wscg2007/Papers_2007/full/C43-full.pdf.

The engine works for both projected terrain and geographic,
whole-earth maps. For the whole-earth case, the faces of a cube are
projected on the earth; the grid lines on each face are great
circles. The file euler.kml illustrates this projection.

Use

Once installed, specify osgearth_engine_seamless as a
pseudo-plugin. For example:

 osgviewer multiple_heightfields.earth.osgearth_engine_seamless

Limitations.

The engine renders the height field and the first image layer from the
map. It ignores all engine parameters for now.
